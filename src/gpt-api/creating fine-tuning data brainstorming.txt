Rough Idea of Getting Data:

Go through scraped_stocks.txt:
	for each company:
		> Record change in value
			- Make sentence; e.g General Electric closed up 7.5% on April 24th, 2023.
		> Search through scraped_news.txt for company name
			- Get paragraph of text around the company name. If there is a signifier word,
			  take the paragraph and append to sentence from earlier. Submit as fine-tuning
			  data with randomly chosen prompt.


Junk Words (for company name): "The" (at beginning)
							   "Inc", "Incorporated", "Corp", "Corporation", "Company" (at end)
							   "," (don't forget to remove commas!)

Signifier Words (for scraped_news.txt): "closed down", "stock", "share", "investor"
