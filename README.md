# CS-Stock-T2 Stock Market Chatbot
Our project has three components:

Data Scraper | 
See the data-scraper folder for a README on how to use the component.


Fine-tuning Component | 
See the gpt-api folder for a README on how to use the component.


Web Interface | 
Make sure you have the Angular 2+ JavaScript framework installed. Then, travel to the web-interface directory.

1. To run the site locally on your machine, run the command "ng serve".
2. To build the site, run the command "ng build". It will end up building outside of the parent directory into a separate folder called CS-Stock-T2-Site. 
  2.1. To change the build location, change the "outputPath" variable in angular.json.
  2.2. To change the final build URL, change the "baseHref" variable in angular.json.
